Why the edits made under my username Hardcore Metallica Fan were reverted? They weren't vandalisms, just closure on some GAs after I voted at New York Dolls FAC. And please don't remove the template from the talk page since I'm retired now.89.205.38.27
Hey man, I'm really not trying to edit war. It's just that this guy is constantly removing relevant information and talking to me through edits instead of my talk page. He seems to care more about the formatting than the actual info.
You, sir, are my hero. Any chance you remember what page that's on?
Congratulations from me as well, use the tools well.  · talk "
COCKSUCKER BEFORE YOU PISS AROUND ON MY WORK
Your vandalism to the Matt Shirvington article has been reverted.  Please don't do it again, or you will be banned.
Sorry if the word 'nonsense' was offensive to you. Anyway, I'm not intending to write anything in the article(wow they would jump on me for vandalism), I'm merely requesting that it be more encyclopedic so one can use it for school as a reference. I have been to the selective breeding page but it's almost a stub. It points to 'animal breeding' which is a short messy article that gives you no info. There must be someone around with expertise in eugenics? 93.161.107.169
